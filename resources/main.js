The Articles of Confederation places a significant amount of power in the hands of a central government while maintaining soverign state powers. Hwoever, the Articles of Confederation remain open to interpretation today-- some say that the Articles of Confederation was a loose union between 13 soverign states in the allegiance of self-defense from Britain. That union, according to some, only exists for the sole purpose of an outside attack-- not for the entire globalization of a single country. The debate between state and federal power remains a disucssion today that stems from these very Articles of Confederation."
